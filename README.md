**`Digital And Analogue Craftsman(Developer/Data Analyst/Professional Procrastinator)`**

I'm an independent ,self-Taught coder and data analyst.I understand the beauty that code imparts  to our day to day lives .Seeing the real actionable  impact as well as  the real problem solving skill that it takes to be a great software developer is what got me into coding and Data analysis .My initial coding projects were guided , but I slowly learnt to build up the courage and skill  to tackle real life problems.Currently I'm focusing on telling impactful and insightful stories through Data, that will incite action for all those who have the power to make decsions.
I post my progress on GitHub and all I want to give to the world other than useful stories and beautiful ,purposeful code is a GitHug.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Rosh's Coding Journey(so far🌠)</h3></summary ⛰️ 🏃‍♂️ 🚶
   I started my coding journey as a naive 3rd year Graduate  ,who decided to tinker with c++ code,as a challenge to see if it wa spossible for me to make real world applications, code across platforms  , technologies ,stacks and skill levels ,And 1 year later ,I'm still here,Typping  , retrypimng  , coding  , compiling  , debugging and finally running code.I know I'm not perfect  , and I have a long journey ahead of me  ,full of frustration  , logical 
   
   And all the while, teaching myself iOS development with a dream to build my own app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Java. A desire that landed me a full-stack software engineering job upon graduation. However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time - YouTube content creation. I eventually ended up quitting my software engineering job to pursue YouTube full-time, and that has been my focus ever since. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of building my own app to pursue the safe route, a job. Now I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world that it being a creator. And it worked out, but again, it became comfortable. It's easier to create a video than go out on a ledge and build my own product. I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of building my own app, my own product. And in order to do that, I'll be implmementing a few measures to streamline my YouTube content to focus more time on fulfilling that dream - a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in 2023 due to the measure I'm putting in place now until the end of 2022. Don't wait up, because I'm coming.
